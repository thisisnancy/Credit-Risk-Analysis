# Credit-Risk-Analysis

### Objective

Perform a detailed analysis of a dataset that includes diverse financial and demographic information about loan applicants. The objective is to identify the factors that impact loan default rates and to devise strategies to reduce lending risks.

### Skills Used

1.Python

2.Pandas

3.Matplotlib

4.Seaborn

### Observations

1. NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE
   
Insight: 90% of the entries are 'Cash loans', while the remaining 10% are 'Revolving loans'.

2. CODE_GENDER

Insight: Although loans are less frequently taken by males, the data indicates that the proportion of male defaulters is notably higher compared to females.

Conclusion: Gender may be a potential factor in assessing loan risk.

3. NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE

Insight: Most loans are taken out by individuals with secondary education, followed by those with higher education.

Conclusion: The default rate is significantly higher among borrowers with only secondary education compared to those with higher education qualifications.

4. NAME_FAMILY_STATUS

Insight: Married individuals are the most common applicants for loans and tend to have lower default rates.

Conclusion: Singles and those in civil marriages exhibit higher default rates, highlighting the influence of marital status on loan repayment behavior.

5. OCCUPATION_TYPE

Insight: Laborers and various staff categories are the most frequent loan applicants.

Conclusion: Managers and high-skilled tech staff prove to be the most reliable in terms of repayment. This underscores the role of occupation type in predicting loan default risk.

### Summary of Analysis

Throughout this project, a series of tasks were conducted that yielded valuable insights into the loan applicant dataset:

✅Identification and handling of missing values.

✅Exploration of variable distributions.

✅Analysis of outliers.

✅Examination of relationships among different attributes.

### Key Takeaways

This analysis establishes a foundational understanding of the dataset and its implications for loan management and risk assessment. These insights can inform decision-making processes such as:

✅Development of predictive models.

✅Refinement of loan approval criteria.

By leveraging these insights, lending practices can be enhanced, and default risks reduced.
